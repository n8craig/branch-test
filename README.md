# Branch test repo
This temporary test repo is about me learning to use branch.

I wrote some some text and made a commit.

Then I added an image.

# This is a heading.
This text was from a single edit.

# This is an additional heading.

It has some text.

## There is a sub-heading

With more text. Some of that text is *italic* and other **bold**.

## A Second sub-heading

It has some more text to it.

This also has an image from Imgur.

# This is a mistaken heading.

I'm going to save and make a commit. Then I am adding more text and appending the commit.
